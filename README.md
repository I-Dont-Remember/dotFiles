# dotfiles

To be used in conjunction with Ansible setup, to make our development environment hardware-independent  
-- Clone and run it from $HOME, so that it will be ~/dotfiles  
-- All files in directory should have dot removed, otherwise install script will be confused

Files to add:  
- gvimrc  
- zshrc  
- vim  
- everything usefulin .config  
- crontab  
- gitconfig  
- gitignore  
- gitattributes  
- need more 'find' aliases/functions
- <!> personal scripts section, pull in and delete that repo
- bash_prompt  
- boilerplate functions for any languages we use, not just bash  
- bash history settings  
- useful c macros  
- start adding useful functions for languages  
- browser settings? let Ansible handle?
