# dotfiles

To be used in conjunction with Ansible setup, to make our development environment hardware-independent  
-- Clone and run it from $HOME, so that it will be ~/dotfiles  
-- All files in directory should have dot removed, otherwise install script will be confused
-- Eventually find a different spot for the boilerplate funcs to go?  

Files to add:  
- gvimrc  
- zshrc  
- vim  
- everything usefulin .config  
- crontab  
- gitconfig  
- gitignore  
- gitattributes  
- sshconfig  
- personal scripts section
- bash_prompt
- boilerplate functions for any languages we use, not just bash
