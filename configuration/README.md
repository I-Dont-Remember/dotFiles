# Laptop Configuration

After trying for a while to use Ansible as our configuration management, it has reached a point
where I need to cut my losses and switch over to shell scripts. I've spent too much time fighting
odd errors from my limited understanding of Ansible and running it against localhost, and the whole
point of this was to save time by automation. Shell scripts I have a better understanding of and
know ways to test each piece individually with Docker. This will eventually get merged over into
my dotfiles repo, as it makes the most sense there.
